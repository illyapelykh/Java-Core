Switzerland has won a case at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) obliging Muslim parents to send their children to mixed swimming lessons.
It said authorities were justified in giving precedence to enforcing "the full school curriculum" and the children's "successful integration" into society.
The ECHR acknowledged that religious freedom was being interfered with.
But judges said it did not amount to a violation.
The case was brought by two Swiss nationals, of Turkish origin, who refused to send their teenage daughters to the compulsory mixed lessons in the city of Basel.
Education officials, however, said that exemptions were available only for girls who had reached the age of puberty - which the girls had not reached at the time.
In 2010, after a long-running dispute, the parents were ordered to pay a combined fine of 1,400 Swiss Francs ($1,380, £1,136) "for acting in breach of their parental duty".
They argued that such treatment was a violation of article nine of the European Convention on Human Rights, which covers the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.

The controversial case was decided on at the European Court of Human Rights
In a statement, the ECHR said the refusal to exempt the girls had interfered with the right to freedom of religion.
But it also said the law involved was designed to "protect foreign pupils from any form of social exclusion" and Switzerland was free to design its education system according to its own needs and traditions.
Schools, it said, played an important role in social integration, and exemptions from some lessons are "justified only in very exceptional circumstances".
Swimming, burkinis, and integration
In 2016, officials in Basel suspended the citizenship process for the family of two teenage Muslim brothers who refused to shake hands with female teachers.
Switzerland has also applied the law to other cases - a man of Bosnian origin was fined last year for refusing to allow his daughter to take part in swimming lessons during school hours, among other activities.
Germany also battled with the issue of mixed swimming lessons in 2013, when a judge ruled that a 13-year-old girl must attend - but allowed the wearing of a burkini.
In France, in 2009, a woman was banned from swimming in a public pool in her burkini. That would be followed in 2016 by a controversial official ban on the garment in public spaces - which was eventually overturned by French courts.
France, Belgium, and the Netherlands all have bans on Muslim veils in public, to varying degrees.

"Accordingly, the children's interest in a full education, thus facilitating their successful social integration according to local customs and mores, prevailed over the parents' wish to have their children exempted from mixed swimming lessons," the court said.
The court also noted that "very flexible arrangements" had been offered as a compromise, including allowing the girls to wear burkinis during lessons rather than traditional swimwear, and allowing them to change clothes with no boys in the room.

JavaScript Variables
❮ PreviousNext ❯
JavaScript Variables
JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
In this example, x, y, and z, are variables:
Example
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
Try it Yourself »
From the example above, you can expect:
x stores the value 5
y stores the value 6
z stores the value 11
Much Like Algebra
In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables:
Example
var price1 = 5;
var price2 = 6;
var total = price1 + price2;
Try it Yourself »
In programming, just like in algebra, we use variables (like price1) to hold values.
In programming, just like in algebra, we use variables in expressions (total = price1 + price2).
From the example above, you can calculate the total to be 11.
JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
The Assignment Operator
In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:
x = x + 5
In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.
(It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)
The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.
JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".
In programming, text values are called text strings.
JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.
Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.
Example
var pi = 3.14;
var person = "John Doe";
var answer = 'Yes I am!';

Declaring (Creating) JavaScript Variables
Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
You declare a JavaScript variable with the var keyword:
var carName;
After the declaration, the variable has no value. (Technically it has the value of undefined)
To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:
carName = "Volvo";
You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it:
var carName = "Volvo";
In the example below, we create a variable called carName and assign the value "Volvo" to it.
Then we "output" the value inside an HTML paragraph with id="demo":
Example
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
var carName = "Volvo";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName; 
</script>
Try it Yourself »
It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
One Statement, Many Variables
You can declare many variables in one statement.
Start the statement with var and separate the variables by comma:
var person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
Try it Yourself »
A declaration can span multiple lines:
var person = "John Doe",
carName = "Volvo",
price = 200;
Try it Yourself »
Value = undefined
In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.
A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.
The variable carName will have the value undefined after the execution of this statement:
Example
var carName;
Try it Yourself »
Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables
If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value.
The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:
Example
var carName = "Volvo";
var carName;

JavaScript Arithmetic
As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like = and +:
Example
var x = 5 + 2 + 3;
Try it Yourself »
You can also add strings, but strings will be concatenated:
Example
var x = "John" + " " + "Doe";
Try it Yourself »
Also try this:
Example
var x = "5" + 2 + 3;
Try it Yourself »
If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
Now try this:
Example
var x = 2 + 3 + "5";
